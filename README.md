## Important observations
- This was one of my first big projects using react, firebase, that I did back in the beginning of 2020. So there is probably a lot of obvious improvements that I could do here in regards to the whole system, code, user experience, user interface, etc üòÅ.
- Zara's website identity changed a bit in 2022, so this project is not that identitical anymore.
- The website is not responsive!
- I don't know why, but the option to buy a product stopped working the last time I checked.
- This was a learning project, so feel free to add functionalities and modify the project the way you want!
